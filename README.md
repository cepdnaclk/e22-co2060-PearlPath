Pearl Path: Sri Lankan Tourism Support Platform

Pearl Path is a centralized digital travel support platform designed to simplify travel planning in Sri Lanka. The system integrates hotels, tourist attractions, transport services, and verified tour guides into a single web-based application.

This project was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to provide a scalable, responsive, and efficient solution for both local and international tourists.

A user-friendly interface for seamless travel planning

The platform focuses on reliability, convenience, and security to make travel faster, easier, and safer.
